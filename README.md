Made in Python using Streamlit, this app, with its improved UI, allows users to create a list of ballet steps with contemporary modifications and traditional facings. Sequences may be saved and downloaded as a .txt file for sharing with other dancers for endless individual creative interpretation. Enjoy! Accessible via mobile or desktop.

  **Interactive_Creativity_Process_Tool**

This interactive tool helps us, as artists, to understand that the creative process is not linear! We are constantly weighing many factors like risk-taking, technical skill, and connecting with ourselves or our audiences. The sliders correspond to aspects measured by The S-curve (sigmoid function), often utilized in innovation and design processes. This tool is meant for reflection on our practice. ❤ Accessible via mobile or desktop.
